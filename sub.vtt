WEBVTT

00:00:23.343 --> 00:00:25.678
Been a while since I was
up here in front of you.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.847
Maybe I'll do us all a favour
and just stick to the cards.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.603
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:36.105
on the freeway and
the rooftop...

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:39.233
Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you honestly
expect us to believe that

00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:42.903
that was a bodyguard in a suit
that conveniently appeared,

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:45.698
despite the fact that you
sorely despise bodyguards?

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:46.907
Yes.

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:51.662
And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.165
with an undisclosed Stark
high-tech powered battle...

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.209
I know that it's confusing.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.838
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:04.133
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:10.431
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:12.725
A laundry list of
character defects,

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:15.644
all the mistakes I've
made, largely public.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.354
The truth is

00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:24.278
I am Iron Man.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.248
Ivan.

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:42.004
Vanya.

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:22.224
270 at 30 knots. Holding
steady at 15,000 feet.

00:05:22.308 --> 00:05:30.308
You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:24.137
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.556
It's good to be back.

00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:30.227
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.481
I missed you, too. Blow something up?
I already did that.

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:37.817
I'm not saying that
the world is enjoying

00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:42.072
its longest period of uninterrupted
peace in years because of me.

00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:50.789
I'm not saying that from
the ashes of captivity,

00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:55.919
never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:04.928
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

00:08:05.012 --> 00:08:06.638
sipping on an iced tea

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:09.766
because I haven't come across
anyone who's man enough

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.727
to go toe-to-toe with
me on my best day.

00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:18.358
I love you, Tony!

00:08:18.442 --> 00:08:20.569
Please, it's not about me.

00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:23.738
It's not about you.

00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:28.994
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:32.831
It's about what we choose to leave
behind for future generations.

00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:37.043
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

00:08:37.128 --> 00:08:39.546
the best and brightest
men and women

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.590
of nations and corporations
the world over

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:45.176
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:48.305
to leave behind a
brighter future.

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:50.140
It's not about us.

00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:54.185
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.813
is welcome back to
the Stark Expo.

00:09:00.568 --> 00:09:03.236
And now, making a special
guest appearance

00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.739
from the great beyond to tell
you what it's all about,

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:08.325
please welcome my
father, Howard.

00:09:10.661 --> 00:09:13.622
Everything is achievable
through technology.

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:15.999
Better living, robust health,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.046
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.048
So, from all of us here
at Stark industries,

00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:27.927
I would like to personally introduce
you to the City of the Future.

00:09:28.012 --> 00:09:31.765
Technology holds infinite
possibilities for mankind,

00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:34.684
and will one day rid
society of all its ills.

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:38.355
Soon, technology will affect the
way you live your life every day.

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:40.023
No more tedious work,

00:09:40.316 --> 00:09:44.736
leaving more time for leisure
activities and enjoying the sweet life.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.572
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:55.664
We are coming to you live from
the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

00:09:55.748 --> 00:09:58.625
where Tony Stark has
just walked offstage.

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:00.293
Don't worry if you can't
make it down here tonight

00:10:00.378 --> 00:10:02.796
because this Expo goes
on all year long.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.881
And I'm gonna be here checking
out all the attractions

00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:08.510
and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.

00:10:08.594 --> 00:10:09.812
Make sure you join me...

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:11.054
All right, it's a zoo
out there, watch out.

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:13.973
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

00:10:14.058 --> 00:10:16.601
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:18.228
Hey, hey...

00:10:18.312 --> 00:10:20.772
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:23.316
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:24.901
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.069
This is Larry.

00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:28.238
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:29.823
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

00:10:29.907 --> 00:10:31.700
- Larry King.
- Larry!

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:34.536
Yes, my people, my people.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.162
Come on, Tony. There we go.

00:10:36.247 --> 00:10:38.123
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:39.499
No, it was perfect.

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.084
Look what we got
here, the new model.

00:10:41.168 --> 00:10:42.877
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

00:10:42.962 --> 00:10:44.045
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.296
- And you are?
- Marshal.

00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:47.298
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:49.551
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

00:10:49.677 --> 00:10:50.885
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:53.722
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

00:10:55.182 --> 00:10:58.268
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.896
He doesn't like to
be handed things.

00:11:02.022 --> 00:11:03.565
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:04.774
You are hereby ordered

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.110
to appear before the Senate
Armed Services Committee

00:11:07.236 --> 00:11:08.862
tomorrow morning at 9: 00 A.M.

00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:10.530
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:12.907
He likes the badge.

00:11:13.033 --> 00:11:15.076
- You still like it?
- Yep.

00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:20.582
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

00:11:23.335 --> 00:11:29.215
Mr. Stark, could we pick up now where
we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.901
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:32.051
Absolutely.

00:11:32.136 --> 00:11:35.096
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:37.474
- I do not. I do not.
- You do not?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.059
Well, it depends on how you
define the word "weapon."

00:11:40.144 --> 00:11:42.812
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.

00:11:42.938 --> 00:11:44.606
Well... How would
you describe it?

00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:47.734
I would describe it by defining
it as what it is, Senator.

00:11:47.818 --> 00:11:51.613
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:52.739
That is... That is...

00:11:52.823 --> 00:11:55.116
That's actually the most apt
description I can make of it.

00:11:55.242 --> 00:11:57.076
It's a weapon. It's a
weapon, Mr. Stark.

00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:00.330
Please, if your priority was actually the
well-being of the American citizen...

00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:03.208
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

00:12:03.292 --> 00:12:06.669
- of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

00:12:07.254 --> 00:12:11.007
I am Iron Man. The
suit and I are one.

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:13.551
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:16.638
which is tantamount to indentured
servitude or prostitution,

00:12:16.764 --> 00:12:18.389
depending on what
state you're in.

00:12:18.474 --> 00:12:21.434
- You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:25.313
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

00:12:26.273 --> 00:12:28.733
I'm no expert in weapons.

00:12:28.818 --> 00:12:30.652
We have somebody here who
is an expert on weapons.

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:35.490
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our
current primary weapons contractor.

00:12:36.492 --> 00:12:39.994
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.412
and I am wondering

00:12:41.497 --> 00:12:45.291
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:53.508
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

00:12:53.634 --> 00:12:55.593
You're the wonder boy.

00:12:55.678 --> 00:12:57.804
Senator, if I may.

00:12:57.888 --> 00:13:02.350
I may well not be an expert, but
you know who was the expert?

00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:05.061
Your dad. Howard Stark.

00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:09.566
Really a father to us all, and
to the military-industrial age.

00:13:10.192 --> 00:13:12.432
Let's just be clear. He
was no flower child.

00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:14.696
He was a lion.

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:17.198
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:21.411
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

00:13:21.537 --> 00:13:24.330
And yet he insists
it's a shield.

00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:29.043
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:32.380
I wish I were comforted,
Anthony, I really do.

00:13:32.506 --> 00:13:35.592
I'd love to leave my door
unlocked when I leave the house,

00:13:35.718 --> 00:13:37.135
but this ain't Canada.

00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:38.887
You know, we live in a
world of grave threats,

00:13:39.013 --> 00:13:42.724
threats that Mr. Stark will not
always be able to foresee.

00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:45.226
Thank you.

00:13:45.352 --> 00:13:48.062
God bless Iron Man.
God bless America.

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:51.274
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.318
The committee would
now like to invite.

00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:56.529
Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes to the chamber.

00:13:56.614 --> 00:13:58.114
Rhodey? What?

00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:07.707
Hey, buddy. I didn't
expect to see you here.

00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:10.418
Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:11.586
I just...

00:14:11.712 --> 00:14:13.152
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:16.674
I have before me a complete
report on the Iron Man weapon,

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:19.427
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

00:14:19.553 --> 00:14:22.639
can you please read page
57, paragraph four?

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.016
You're requesting that I
read specific selections

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.392
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:28.394
It was my understanding that
I was going to be testifying

00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:30.647
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

00:14:30.773 --> 00:14:32.357
I understand. A lot of
things have changed today.

00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:33.733
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

00:14:33.817 --> 00:14:36.319
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.614
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

00:14:40.658 --> 00:14:42.075
Very well.

00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:47.288
"As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,."

00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:53.378
"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation"

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:54.879
"and to her interests."

00:14:54.964 --> 00:14:56.839
I did, however, go
on to summarise

00:14:56.966 --> 00:14:59.634
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.886
- And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.

00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:03.137
To fold Mr. Stark...
- That's enough.

00:15:03.263 --> 00:15:04.764
Into the existing chain
of command, Senator.

00:15:04.848 --> 00:15:08.226
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.979
We can amend the
hours a little bit.

00:15:11.647 --> 00:15:13.398
I'd like to go on
and show, if I may,

00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:15.650
the imagery that's
connected to your report.

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:18.611
I believe it is somewhat
premature to reveal these images

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:20.488
- to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect,

00:15:20.614 --> 00:15:21.781
Colonel, I understand.

00:15:21.865 --> 00:15:25.952
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:27.996
Let's have the images.

00:15:29.456 --> 00:15:32.667
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

00:15:32.793 --> 00:15:35.628
are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies

00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:37.171
of Mr. Stark's suit.

00:15:37.297 --> 00:15:42.301
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:47.515
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:51.602
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

00:15:52.187 --> 00:15:55.189
Boy, I'm good. I
commandeered your screens.

00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:58.693
I need them. Time for a
little transparency.

00:15:58.944 --> 00:16:00.695
- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:04.032
If you will direct your
attention to said screens...

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:05.700
I believe that's North Korea.

00:16:13.917 --> 00:16:16.794
Can you turn that off?
Take it off.

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:18.046
Iran.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.553
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:28.097
How did Hammer get in the game?

00:16:28.891 --> 00:16:30.808
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:35.396
Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good.
Turn to the right.

00:16:37.775 --> 00:16:40.526
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:41.778
Wow.

00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:46.532
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

00:16:46.617 --> 00:16:47.909
Hammer Industries, 20.

00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:50.620
I'd like to point out that
that test pilot survived.

00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:52.246
I think we're done, is the
point that he's making.

00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:55.541
- I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:58.461
- For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

00:16:58.587 --> 00:17:01.088
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

00:17:01.173 --> 00:17:03.090
You want my property?
You can't have it.

00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:04.592
But I did you a big favour.

00:17:05.344 --> 00:17:08.262
I've successfully
privatized world peace.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.643
What more do you want? For now!

00:17:14.686 --> 00:17:17.313
I tried to play ball
with these ass-clowns.

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:20.775
You, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.

00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:22.985
We're adjourned. We're
adjourned for today.

00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:25.363
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:33.454
My bond is with the people.

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:38.793
And I will serve this great
nation at the pleasure of myself.

00:17:39.127 --> 00:17:40.461
If there's one thing I've proven

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:43.881
it's that you can count
on me to pleasure myself.

00:18:19.585 --> 00:18:21.085
Wake up. Daddy's home.

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:22.753
Welcome home, sir.

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:24.714
Congratulations on the
opening ceremonies.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.842
They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.

00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:29.677
And may I say how
refreshing it is

00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.514
to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

00:18:35.434 --> 00:18:36.559
You!

00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:39.353
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:42.023
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:44.775
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.943
am I supposed to drink?

00:18:46.028 --> 00:18:50.031
We are up to 80 ounces a day to
counteract the symptoms, sir.

00:18:50.949 --> 00:18:52.950
Check palladium levels.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.204
Blood toxicity, 24%.

00:18:58.707 --> 00:19:01.042
It appears that the continued
use of the Iron Man suit

00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:03.544
is accelerating your condition.

00:19:05.047 --> 00:19:07.423
Another core has been depleted.

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:12.470
God, they're running out quick.

00:19:12.554 --> 00:19:15.222
I have run simulations
on every known element,

00:19:15.307 --> 00:19:17.350
and none can serve as
a viable replacement

00:19:17.434 --> 00:19:19.435
for the palladium core.

00:19:21.647 --> 00:19:24.732
You are running out of
both time and options.

00:19:28.445 --> 00:19:31.155
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive

00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:33.074
is also killing you.

00:19:34.576 --> 00:19:35.993
Miss Potts is approaching.

00:19:36.078 --> 00:19:38.996
- I recommend that you inform her...
- Mute.

00:19:42.084 --> 00:19:43.668
Is this a joke?

00:19:45.087 --> 00:19:46.754
- What are you thinking?
- What?

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:49.131
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

00:19:49.257 --> 00:19:51.550
And you're angry
about something.

00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:53.010
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

00:19:53.095 --> 00:19:54.512
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:58.140
Our entire modern art
collection to the...

00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.850
- Boy Scouts of America.
...Boy Scouts of America?

00:19:59.935 --> 00:20:01.727
Yes. It is a worthwhile
organisation.

00:20:01.812 --> 00:20:05.189
I didn't physically check the
crates but, basically, yes.

00:20:05.273 --> 00:20:07.441
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No of fence.

00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.568
No, you know what? I think
I'm actually entitled

00:20:09.653 --> 00:20:11.237
to say "our" collection

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:14.532
considering the time that
I put in, over 10 years,

00:20:14.616 --> 00:20:16.450
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

00:20:16.535 --> 00:20:19.620
You know, there's only
about 8,011things

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:21.664
that I really need to
talk to you about.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.207
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:24.750
The Bridgeport's already
machining that part.

00:20:24.835 --> 00:20:27.211
The Expo is a gigantic
waste of time.

00:20:27.295 --> 00:20:29.547
I need you to wear a surgical
mask until you're feeling better.

00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:30.798
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:32.258
There's nothing more important
to me than the Expo.

00:20:32.342 --> 00:20:33.676
It's my primary
point of concern.

00:20:33.802 --> 00:20:36.929
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

00:20:37.014 --> 00:20:38.806
Wow. Look at that.

00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:42.393
That's modern art.
That's going up.

00:20:42.477 --> 00:20:45.229
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

00:20:45.313 --> 00:20:47.523
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

00:20:47.607 --> 00:20:50.026
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

00:20:50.027 --> 00:20:52.361
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

00:20:52.446 --> 00:20:53.946
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:55.614
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

00:20:55.699 --> 00:20:57.408
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

00:20:57.492 --> 00:20:58.993
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

00:20:59.077 --> 00:21:00.357
I'm just replacing it with this.

00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:01.787
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

00:21:01.872 --> 00:21:04.999
My point is, we have
already awarded contracts

00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:06.751
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

00:21:06.835 --> 00:21:08.919
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

00:21:09.004 --> 00:21:11.130
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

00:21:11.214 --> 00:21:13.007
- Everything was my idea... and
you won't make a decision.

00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.800
I don't care about the
liberal agenda any more.

00:21:14.885 --> 00:21:17.261
It's boring. Boring. I'm
giving you a boring alert.

00:21:17.345 --> 00:21:19.638
- You do it.
- I do what?

00:21:19.723 --> 00:21:21.682
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:24.560
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:26.062
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:27.813
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

00:21:27.898 --> 00:21:29.098
in order to...
- I'm asking you

00:21:29.107 --> 00:21:30.316
to physically do it.
I need you to do it.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.151
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

00:21:32.235 --> 00:21:34.153
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

00:21:34.237 --> 00:21:36.113
Why won't you let me?

00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:39.658
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:45.831
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

00:21:45.916 --> 00:21:47.833
effective immediately.

00:21:50.003 --> 00:21:51.921
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:55.966
I've actually given this a
fair amount of thought,

00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:59.970
believe it or not. Doing a bit
of headhunting, so to speak,

00:22:00.222 --> 00:22:03.933
trying to figure out who a
worthy successor would be.

00:22:04.017 --> 00:22:05.810
And then I realised

00:22:08.355 --> 00:22:10.898
it's you. It's always been you.

00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:14.026
I thought there'd
be a legal issue,

00:22:14.111 --> 00:22:17.571
but actually I'm capable of
appointing my successor.

00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:20.282
My successor being you.

00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:24.120
Congratulations?

00:22:25.872 --> 00:22:27.456
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

00:22:27.541 --> 00:22:29.333
Don't think. Drink.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.507
There you go.

00:23:16.256 --> 00:23:19.508
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:21.802
I'm on happy time.

00:23:28.018 --> 00:23:29.351
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

00:23:29.352 --> 00:23:31.770
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:34.023
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

00:23:34.024 --> 00:23:36.483
All right, put them up. Come on.

00:23:39.154 --> 00:23:44.033
I promise you this is the only time I
will ask you to sign over your company.

00:23:45.243 --> 00:23:47.620
I need you to initial each box.

00:23:48.205 --> 00:23:50.956
Lesson one. Never
take your eye off...

00:23:53.251 --> 00:23:54.460
That's it. I'm done.

00:23:54.544 --> 00:23:56.962
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

00:23:57.047 --> 00:23:58.631
Front and center.
Come into the church.

00:23:58.715 --> 00:24:02.509
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- If it pleases the court, which it does.

00:24:02.594 --> 00:24:05.930
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

00:24:19.486 --> 00:24:20.653
What?

00:24:24.407 --> 00:24:27.201
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

00:24:27.494 --> 00:24:29.286
- Pepper.
- What?

00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:32.790
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

00:24:32.874 --> 00:24:36.961
And she is potentially a very
expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:39.213
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

00:24:39.297 --> 00:24:42.091
Yes, and I've got three
excellent potential candidates.

00:24:42.217 --> 00:24:43.801
They're lined up and
ready to meet you.

00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:45.229
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now.

00:24:45.242 --> 00:24:46.679
I feel like it's her.

00:24:46.763 --> 00:24:47.846
No, it's not.

00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:49.723
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

00:24:49.808 --> 00:24:53.769
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp?
Crunch? Something like that?

00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:57.606
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

00:24:57.691 --> 00:25:02.111
- What, are you gonna Google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

00:25:02.195 --> 00:25:05.864
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:08.117
She's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin.

00:25:08.201 --> 00:25:10.077
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:12.454
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:14.331
You can read Latin or
you can write Latin,

00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:16.000
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

00:25:16.084 --> 00:25:17.835
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:19.295
I need her. She's got
everything that I need.

00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:23.007
Rule number one, never take
your eye off your opponent.

00:25:24.217 --> 00:25:25.634
Oh, my God!

00:25:27.887 --> 00:25:30.639
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:25:30.724 --> 00:25:32.057
- I just slipped.
- You did?

00:25:32.142 --> 00:25:34.476
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

00:25:36.813 --> 00:25:39.023
Just... I need your impression.

00:25:39.107 --> 00:25:41.817
You have a quiet reserve. I don't
know, you have an old soul.

00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:44.403
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.784
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

00:25:52.037 --> 00:25:55.247
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

00:25:55.332 --> 00:25:57.291
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:59.209
Thank you very much.

00:26:02.213 --> 00:26:03.881
- I want one.
- No.

00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.167
You know, it's Europe. Whatever
happens the next 20 minutes,

00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:41.502
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

00:26:41.586 --> 00:26:43.128
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.

00:26:43.213 --> 00:26:44.421
Hello. How was your flight?

00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:46.006
It was excellent. Boy,
it's nice to see you.

00:26:46.091 --> 00:26:50.260
We have one photographer from the
ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:52.429
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

00:26:52.514 --> 00:26:55.057
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:56.266
Stop acting constipated.

00:26:56.351 --> 00:26:57.810
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

00:26:57.894 --> 00:26:58.936
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.729
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

00:27:00.814 --> 00:27:02.731
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

00:27:02.732 --> 00:27:04.650
You have a 9: 30 dinner.

00:27:04.734 --> 00:27:06.485
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11: 00.
- Absolutely.

00:27:06.569 --> 00:27:08.404
- Is this us?
- It can be.

00:27:08.488 --> 00:27:10.155
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.699
- Mr. Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

00:27:12.784 --> 00:27:14.660
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

00:27:14.744 --> 00:27:16.995
Elon, how's it going? Those
Merlin engines are fantastic.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.081
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an
idea for an electric jet.

00:27:19.165 --> 00:27:20.249
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:22.376
Then we'll make it work.

00:27:22.752 --> 00:27:24.211
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

00:27:24.295 --> 00:27:25.754
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:27.256
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.507
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:29.716
Thank you very much.

00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:31.760
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

00:27:31.845 --> 00:27:33.387
Anthony! Is that you?

00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:34.763
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:36.140
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

00:27:36.224 --> 00:27:39.017
You're not the only rich
guy here with a fancy car.

00:27:39.102 --> 00:27:41.520
You know Christine
Everhart from Vanity Fair.

00:27:41.604 --> 00:27:42.813
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:44.064
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:45.315
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.445
BTW, big story. The new
CEO of Stark Industries.

00:27:49.529 --> 00:27:50.850
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:54.366
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:55.617
- Can I?
- Sure.

00:27:55.702 --> 00:27:58.203
She's actually doing a big
spread on me for Vanity Fair.

00:27:58.288 --> 00:28:00.205
I thought I'd throw
her a bone, you know.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.373
- Right.
- Right?

00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:04.835
Well, she did quite a
spread on Tony last year.

00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:06.253
And she wrote a story as well.

00:28:06.337 --> 00:28:08.380
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

00:28:08.465 --> 00:28:10.507
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:12.072
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

00:28:12.135 --> 00:28:13.594
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

00:28:13.678 --> 00:28:14.970
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

00:28:15.054 --> 00:28:16.356
Can I ask you... Is
this the first time...

00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:17.681
Fromage.

00:28:17.765 --> 00:28:19.266
- Say, "Brie." ...that you
guys have seen each other?

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.602
God, that's so awful.

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:24.062
Listen, is it the first time you've
seen each other since the Senate?

00:28:24.147 --> 00:28:25.814
Since he got his
contract revoked...

00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:28.180
- Actually, it's on hold... when
you were attempting to...

00:28:28.193 --> 00:28:30.194
That's not what I heard. What's
the difference between "hold"

00:28:30.278 --> 00:28:32.112
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

00:28:32.197 --> 00:28:34.573
No. The truth is... Why
don't we put that away?

00:28:34.657 --> 00:28:38.660
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

00:28:38.745 --> 00:28:41.121
Well, if you invent
something that works,

00:28:41.206 --> 00:28:42.623
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

00:28:42.707 --> 00:28:44.917
- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

00:28:45.001 --> 00:28:47.211
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

00:28:47.295 --> 00:28:50.464
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

00:28:51.341 --> 00:28:52.508
We kid. We're kidders.

00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:16.907
Got any other bad ideas?

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.287
Tony!

00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:30.420
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

00:29:30.505 --> 00:29:32.965
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:35.551
for Hammer Industries, you know?

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:38.971
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- Well, what's the use of having...

00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:41.932
is a healthy... and
owning a race car...

00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:44.977
competition... if
you don't drive it?

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.563
Is he driving?

00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:56.530
Natalie. Natalie!

00:29:57.448 --> 00:29:58.657
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

00:29:58.741 --> 00:30:00.951
This is the first that
I have known of it.

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:02.786
This... This cannot happen.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.538
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

00:30:04.622 --> 00:30:05.872
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

00:30:05.957 --> 00:30:07.833
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:10.711
Tony's... You know, he...

00:30:10.795 --> 00:30:12.671
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:13.839
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

00:30:13.923 --> 00:30:16.883
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

00:30:16.968 --> 00:30:18.176
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

00:30:18.261 --> 00:30:19.511
But I have to make one
quick phone call.

00:30:19.596 --> 00:30:20.679
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

00:30:20.763 --> 00:30:22.139
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

00:30:22.223 --> 00:30:23.724
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:25.309
That's Stark.

00:32:23.302 --> 00:32:24.553
Go, go!

00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:29.433
Hang on.

00:33:38.377 --> 00:33:40.212
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:41.880
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

00:33:41.964 --> 00:33:43.131
Car!

00:34:46.779 --> 00:34:48.196
Oh, my God!

00:34:54.787 --> 00:34:57.330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:34:58.165 --> 00:35:00.333
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:02.419
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

00:35:02.503 --> 00:35:04.462
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

00:35:04.547 --> 00:35:06.298
I was attacked! We
need better security.

00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:08.633
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

00:35:08.718 --> 00:35:10.468
God, it's embarrassing.

00:35:11.304 --> 00:35:13.555
First vacation in two years.

00:35:18.227 --> 00:35:19.644
Oh, my God!

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.981
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:24.941
Football.

00:35:27.403 --> 00:35:29.446
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.197
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

00:35:31.282 --> 00:35:33.116
Stop banging the car!

00:35:36.245 --> 00:35:37.621
Calm down.

00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:40.540
God! God!

00:35:43.127 --> 00:35:51.127
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

00:37:18.264 --> 00:37:19.931
You... You lose.

00:37:26.272 --> 00:37:28.898
You lose. You lose, Stark.

00:38:22.453 --> 00:38:26.122
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per
second were a little low.

00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:34.798
You could have doubled
up your rotations.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.261
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

00:38:40.346 --> 00:38:43.264
It's effective. Not
very efficient.

00:38:44.308 --> 00:38:46.643
But it's a passable knock-off.

00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:48.853
I don't get it. A
little fine tuning,

00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:50.730
you could have made
a solid paycheck.

00:38:50.815 --> 00:38:54.984
You could have sold it to
North Korea, China, Iran,

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:57.695
or gone right to
the black market.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.740
You look like you got
friends in low places.

00:39:00.825 --> 00:39:06.371
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

00:39:07.748 --> 00:39:10.041
And now, like all guilty men,

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.586
you try to rewrite
your own history.

00:39:14.255 --> 00:39:19.259
And you forget all the lives the
Stark family has destroyed.

00:39:20.427 --> 00:39:23.680
Speaking of thieves, where
did you get this design?

00:39:23.764 --> 00:39:26.683
My father. Anton Vanko.

00:39:27.893 --> 00:39:30.061
Well, I never heard of him.

00:39:31.146 --> 00:39:33.857
My father is the
reason you're alive.

00:39:34.108 --> 00:39:36.109
The reason I'm alive is 'cause
you had a shot, you took it,

00:39:36.193 --> 00:39:37.735
you missed.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.028
Did I?

00:39:41.907 --> 00:39:44.033
If you can make God bleed,

00:39:45.035 --> 00:39:47.912
the people will cease
to believe in him.

00:39:49.248 --> 00:39:53.585
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

00:39:55.588 --> 00:40:00.008
The truth, all I have to
do is sit here and watch

00:40:00.092 --> 00:40:02.594
as the world will consume you.

00:40:02.678 --> 00:40:04.762
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

00:40:04.847 --> 00:40:08.766
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

00:40:08.851 --> 00:40:11.144
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

00:40:11.228 --> 00:40:14.606
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:35.501
It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle

00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:38.046
and this man has no
idea what he's doing.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.883
He thinks of the Iron
Man weapon as a toy.

00:40:41.967 --> 00:40:46.804
I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant

00:40:46.889 --> 00:40:50.516
that these suits can't
exist anywhere else,

00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:53.144
don't exist anywhere else, never
will exist anywhere else,

00:40:53.228 --> 00:40:54.562
at least for five to 10 years,

00:40:54.647 --> 00:40:59.275
and here we are in Monaco
realising, "These suits exist now."

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.526
Mute.

00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:06.115
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

00:41:09.662 --> 00:41:13.456
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.628
Did you just make that?

00:41:18.712 --> 00:41:22.131
Yeah. Where do you think
I've been for three hours?

00:41:23.133 --> 00:41:24.300
Tony,

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.721
what are you not telling me?

00:41:32.643 --> 00:41:35.645
I don't want to go home. At all.

00:41:37.898 --> 00:41:40.608
Let's cancel my
birthday party and...

00:41:40.693 --> 00:41:43.277
We're in Europe. Let's
go to Venice, Cipriani.

00:41:43.362 --> 00:41:44.570
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:46.531
It's a great place to

00:41:49.034 --> 00:41:52.161
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

00:41:52.246 --> 00:41:54.497
We're in kind of a mess.

00:41:54.581 --> 00:41:56.207
Yeah, but maybe that's
why it's the best time.

00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:58.334
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

00:41:58.419 --> 00:41:59.544
I need to show up.

00:41:59.628 --> 00:42:03.923
As CEO, you are
entitled to a leave.

00:42:04.008 --> 00:42:05.341
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

00:42:05.426 --> 00:42:07.969
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

00:42:08.053 --> 00:42:11.639
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:14.475
Not everybody runs
on batteries, Tony.

00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:28.568
Hey, there he is.

00:44:29.278 --> 00:44:30.736
There he is.

00:44:32.656 --> 00:44:35.825
What an absolute pleasure.
Welcome.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.952
Oh, goodness gracious.

00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:41.581
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

00:44:41.665 --> 00:44:45.168
Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm
such a huge fan of yours.

00:44:45.252 --> 00:44:49.046
I didn't want to make a
first impression like this.

00:44:49.131 --> 00:44:51.424
He's not an animal. Come on.

00:44:52.301 --> 00:44:54.969
He's a human being. Thank you.

00:45:00.017 --> 00:45:01.434
We're fine.

00:45:03.103 --> 00:45:04.770
My name is Justin Hammer.

00:45:04.855 --> 00:45:08.191
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

00:45:11.945 --> 00:45:14.405
Dig in. What do we
have today, Jack?

00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:17.825
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

00:45:19.286 --> 00:45:21.120
Anything you want
here, we got it.

00:45:21.205 --> 00:45:25.291
I like my dessert first. I had
this flown in from San Francisco.

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.251
It's Italian, though.

00:45:27.336 --> 00:45:29.128
Organic ice cream.

00:45:29.213 --> 00:45:33.132
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently
you do, too, for Tony Stark.

00:45:35.052 --> 00:45:37.845
What I saw you do to Tony
Stark on that track,

00:45:37.971 --> 00:45:41.599
how you stepped up to him in
front of God and everybody,

00:45:41.683 --> 00:45:43.809
that was... Wow!

00:45:43.894 --> 00:45:45.436
You spoke to me
with what you did.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.147
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

00:45:48.232 --> 00:45:49.774
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:52.652
to God knows where. It would have
been such a waste of talent.

00:45:52.736 --> 00:45:54.070
But if I might
make a suggestion,

00:45:54.154 --> 00:45:56.864
you know, you don't just go
and try and kill the guy.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.202
I think, if I may, you
go after his legacy.

00:46:01.328 --> 00:46:03.371
That's what you kill.

00:46:03.497 --> 00:46:06.457
You and me, we are a lot
alike in a lot of ways.

00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:11.170
The only difference between you
and I is that I have resources.

00:46:12.005 --> 00:46:14.423
I think, if I may,

00:46:14.508 --> 00:46:16.842
you need my resources.

00:46:16.927 --> 00:46:19.512
Someone behind
you, a benefactor.

00:46:19.596 --> 00:46:21.681
I'd like to be that guy.

00:46:33.568 --> 00:46:37.863
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

00:46:37.948 --> 00:46:40.783
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

00:46:40.867 --> 00:46:42.285
Very good, man.

00:46:42.369 --> 00:46:45.538
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

00:46:45.622 --> 00:46:46.747
Hey!

00:46:48.292 --> 00:46:50.459
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:46:50.544 --> 00:46:52.128
I want my bird.

00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:57.800
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

00:46:57.884 --> 00:46:59.552
I can get you a bird. I
can get you 10 birds.

00:46:59.636 --> 00:47:01.178
I want my bird.

00:47:01.263 --> 00:47:03.806
Well, okay. Nothing's impossible.
I could...

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.560
Are we talking about... Is
this a bird back in Russia?

00:47:07.644 --> 00:47:10.688
Yes, but the fundamentals of the
company are still very, very strong

00:47:10.772 --> 00:47:12.692
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

00:47:12.774 --> 00:47:16.235
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.820
Where is he?

00:47:17.904 --> 00:47:19.697
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

00:47:19.781 --> 00:47:21.261
What happened in Monaco?
- Yes, but...

00:47:21.325 --> 00:47:23.826
But his continuing
erratic behaviour

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.037
may lead many people
to ask themselves,

00:47:26.121 --> 00:47:27.955
"Can this man still protect us?"

00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:31.334
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

00:47:32.627 --> 00:47:37.006
Query complete, sir. Anton
Vanko was a Soviet physicist

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.092
who defected to the
United States in 1963.

00:47:40.177 --> 00:47:44.347
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

00:47:44.431 --> 00:47:46.807
His son, Ivan, who
is also a physicist,

00:47:46.933 --> 00:47:51.645
was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

00:47:51.772 --> 00:47:54.231
and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.

00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:56.442
No further records exist.

00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:02.615
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:04.950
and get on top of this
situation right now.

00:48:05.035 --> 00:48:08.037
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

00:48:09.373 --> 00:48:12.208
trying to talk them out of
rolling tanks up the PCH,

00:48:12.292 --> 00:48:15.169
knocking down your front
door and taking these.

00:48:15.295 --> 00:48:17.296
They're gonna take your
suits, Tony, okay?

00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:19.298
They're sick of the games.

00:48:19.383 --> 00:48:22.593
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:25.888
Well, guess what? Somebody
else had it yesterday.

00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:28.307
It's not theoretical any more.

00:48:29.518 --> 00:48:31.560
Are you listening to me?

00:48:33.688 --> 00:48:35.314
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

00:48:39.694 --> 00:48:42.238
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

00:48:44.574 --> 00:48:47.952
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

00:48:48.036 --> 00:48:50.162
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

00:48:50.539 --> 00:48:52.164
It's palladium.

00:48:59.172 --> 00:49:00.631
Is that supposed to be smoking?

00:49:00.715 --> 00:49:05.010
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

00:49:08.723 --> 00:49:10.850
You had this in your body?

00:49:15.689 --> 00:49:19.525
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:21.026
Road rash.

00:49:24.406 --> 00:49:25.781
Thank you.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:40.713
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:43.841
You wanna do this whole
lone gunslinger act

00:49:43.925 --> 00:49:46.051
and it's unnecessary. You
don't have to do this alone.

00:49:46.052 --> 00:49:48.262
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

00:49:48.388 --> 00:49:50.598
But you've gotta trust me.

00:49:50.724 --> 00:49:54.476
Contrary to popular belief, I
know exactly what I'm doing.

00:50:03.236 --> 00:50:05.529
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

00:50:05.614 --> 00:50:09.074
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

00:50:09.159 --> 00:50:10.576
No pressure.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.662
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

00:50:13.747 --> 00:50:15.227
I may have done a
few miscalculations

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.291
and rushed the prototype
into production.

00:50:17.417 --> 00:50:19.251
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

00:50:19.336 --> 00:50:21.629
Go ahead, take a look around.

00:50:26.426 --> 00:50:28.344
You don't wanna do that.

00:50:28.428 --> 00:50:30.054
You'll be able to access that

00:50:30.138 --> 00:50:32.058
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.225
Can we generate some
encrypted pass codes?

00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:37.436
Get some of those encrypted
pass codes, Jack.

00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:40.272
Never mind, I...

00:50:41.524 --> 00:50:44.818
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.615
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

00:50:51.868 --> 00:50:53.118
Well...

00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:56.038
You're good.

00:50:56.289 --> 00:50:59.458
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.587
Let me show you where you're
gonna be working primarily.

00:51:03.672 --> 00:51:05.631
Go ahead, take a look.

00:51:06.508 --> 00:51:09.134
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

00:51:09.219 --> 00:51:11.220
You know, those are really
just for show and tell.

00:51:11.304 --> 00:51:16.308
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

00:51:18.395 --> 00:51:21.313
Jesus Christ. Get
somebody up here.

00:51:22.148 --> 00:51:24.733
That's where the pilot goes.

00:51:24.818 --> 00:51:28.862
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:32.116
I'll take care of
that, just leave it.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.701
What you want them do?

00:51:33.827 --> 00:51:38.998
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

00:51:39.082 --> 00:51:41.125
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

00:51:41.209 --> 00:51:42.418
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

00:51:42.419 --> 00:51:44.336
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:45.838
You know what I'm talking about?

00:51:45.922 --> 00:51:48.090
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

00:51:48.174 --> 00:51:50.342
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

00:51:50.427 --> 00:51:53.137
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:05.190
Do you know which watch you'd
like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?

00:52:05.525 --> 00:52:07.526
I'll give them a look.

00:52:10.405 --> 00:52:11.864
I should cancel the party.

00:52:12.949 --> 00:52:14.199
- Probably.
- Yeah.

00:52:14.284 --> 00:52:16.910
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

00:52:17.037 --> 00:52:18.495
Right, sends the wrong message.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.080
Inappropriate.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.213
Is that dirty enough for you?

00:52:29.215 --> 00:52:32.968
Gold face, brown band. The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.928
Bring them over here.

00:52:38.224 --> 00:52:40.392
I'll take that. Why don't you...

00:52:52.447 --> 00:52:54.782
I gotta say it. It's hard
to get a read on you.

00:52:55.075 --> 00:52:57.242
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

00:52:59.954 --> 00:53:02.081
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

00:53:02.165 --> 00:53:03.457
Bit odd.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.127
If this was your last birthday
party you were ever gonna have,

00:53:07.253 --> 00:53:08.796
how would you celebrate it?

00:53:11.466 --> 00:53:15.636
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with
whoever I wanted to do it with.

00:53:46.292 --> 00:53:48.460
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:51.338
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:55.676
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

00:53:55.802 --> 00:53:58.095
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

00:53:58.179 --> 00:54:00.013
Iron Man will be back on watch.

00:54:07.313 --> 00:54:08.814
Hey, Pepper.

00:54:09.149 --> 00:54:11.233
I'm going to go get some air.

00:54:11.317 --> 00:54:12.693
What's wrong?

00:54:13.486 --> 00:54:15.821
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:54:21.995 --> 00:54:24.636
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

00:54:24.706 --> 00:54:26.623
This is ridiculous. I just stuck
my neck out for this guy.

00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:27.958
I know. I know. I get it.

00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:29.293
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

00:54:29.377 --> 00:54:32.337
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

00:54:33.506 --> 00:54:35.174
You know, the question I
get asked most often is,

00:54:35.258 --> 00:54:37.759
"Tony, how do you go to the
bathroom in the suit?"

00:54:41.181 --> 00:54:42.598
Just like that.

00:54:46.227 --> 00:54:49.188
Does this guy know how to
throw a party or what?

00:54:52.859 --> 00:54:53.901
I love you.

00:54:54.027 --> 00:54:56.653
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

00:54:56.738 --> 00:55:00.699
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

00:55:00.783 --> 00:55:04.786
And we're gonna say good night
now, and thank you all for coming.

00:55:04.871 --> 00:55:06.079
No, no, no, we can't...
Wait, wait, wait.

00:55:06.206 --> 00:55:07.956
We didn't have the cake. We
didn't blow out the candles.

00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.834
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

00:55:10.919 --> 00:55:13.253
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

00:55:13.379 --> 00:55:14.463
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

00:55:14.547 --> 00:55:15.756
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

00:55:15.882 --> 00:55:17.216
You just peed the suit.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.759
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

00:55:18.885 --> 00:55:20.260
You could drink that water.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.931
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

00:55:24.057 --> 00:55:25.766
- If you say so.
- Okay.

00:55:25.892 --> 00:55:28.060
I'll take this, you take that.

00:55:29.437 --> 00:55:31.063
Pepper Potts.

00:55:32.398 --> 00:55:33.899
She's right. The party's over.

00:55:33.983 --> 00:55:36.944
Then again, the party was over for
me, like, an hour and a half ago.

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:40.572
The after-party
starts in 15 minutes.

00:55:44.118 --> 00:55:48.288
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't
like it, there's the door.

00:55:54.754 --> 00:55:56.129
Yeah!

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:01.760
Hit!

00:56:08.935 --> 00:56:09.435
Pull!

00:56:29.622 --> 00:56:31.790
I think she wants the Gallagher!

00:56:41.134 --> 00:56:43.051
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:56:46.556 --> 00:56:47.889
Get out.

00:56:54.397 --> 00:56:57.482
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:00.277
Goldstein.

00:57:01.529 --> 00:57:02.738
Yes, Mr. Stark?

00:57:02.822 --> 00:57:06.074
Give me a phat beat to
beat my buddy's ass to.

00:57:09.871 --> 00:57:11.872
I told you to shut it down.

00:57:22.383 --> 00:57:25.969
Now, put that thing back where you
found it before someone gets hurt.

00:57:32.685 --> 00:57:33.935
Really?

00:57:41.736 --> 00:57:45.322
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man
doesn't have a sidekick.

00:57:45.907 --> 00:57:48.158
Sidekick this!

00:57:56.668 --> 00:57:58.168
Had enough?

00:57:59.087 --> 00:58:00.545
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:02.756
Don't you "Miss Potts" me!
I'm on to you.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.883
You know what? Ever
since you came here...

00:58:08.596 --> 00:58:09.638
Pepper!

00:58:11.182 --> 00:58:12.516
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

00:58:18.773 --> 00:58:21.525
You want it? Take it!

00:59:02.775 --> 00:59:03.984
Put your hand down.

00:59:04.068 --> 00:59:06.278
You think you got what it
takes to wear that suit?

00:59:06.362 --> 00:59:07.654
We don't have to do this, Tony.

00:59:07.947 --> 00:59:09.614
You wanna be the War
Machine, take your shot.

00:59:09.699 --> 00:59:11.533
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

00:59:11.617 --> 00:59:12.868
- Put it down!
- No!

00:59:12.952 --> 00:59:14.411
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:27.859
Edwards Tower, this is
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:31.154
inbound from three miles
east at 5,000 feet...

01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:16.908
Colonel.

01:01:17.869 --> 01:01:19.119
Major.

01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:20.996
Wow.

01:01:22.206 --> 01:01:23.498
Yeah.

01:01:25.334 --> 01:01:27.252
Let's take it inside.

01:01:27.336 --> 01:01:28.837
Clear the area.

01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:52.819
Sir!

01:01:52.904 --> 01:01:55.363
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.651
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

01:02:02.455 --> 01:02:06.124
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:09.419
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

01:02:10.922 --> 01:02:12.255
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.132
Do I look at the
patch or the eye?

01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:16.343
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

01:02:16.427 --> 01:02:18.762
I'm not sure if you're
real or if I'm having...

01:02:18.846 --> 01:02:20.931
I am very real.

01:02:21.015 --> 01:02:23.016
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

01:02:23.517 --> 01:02:26.770
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

01:02:27.521 --> 01:02:29.522
I've been worse.

01:02:31.192 --> 01:02:32.317
We've secured the perimeter,

01:02:32.318 --> 01:02:35.195
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:41.618
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:45.538
Tony, I want you to
meet Agent Romanoff.

01:02:45.623 --> 01:02:46.748
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.I.D. shadow.

01:02:46.832 --> 01:02:49.459
Once we knew you were ill, I was
tasked to you by Director Fury.

01:02:49.543 --> 01:02:51.378
I suggest you apologise.

01:02:51.462 --> 01:02:53.004
You've been very busy.

01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:56.341
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

01:02:56.425 --> 01:02:59.427
You let your friend fly
away with your suit.

01:02:59.512 --> 01:03:00.887
Now, if I didn't know better...

01:03:00.972 --> 01:03:02.973
You don't know better. I didn't
give it to him. He took it.

01:03:03.057 --> 01:03:05.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.020
You're Iron Man and
he just took it?

01:03:09.105 --> 01:03:11.905
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

01:03:11.983 --> 01:03:13.191
Is that possible?

01:03:13.275 --> 01:03:15.902
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

01:03:15.987 --> 01:03:18.989
there are redundancies to
prevent unauthorised usage.

01:03:21.784 --> 01:03:24.411
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

01:03:24.495 --> 01:03:26.371
What do you want from me?

01:03:26.455 --> 01:03:30.125
You have become a problem, a
problem I have to deal with.

01:03:30.209 --> 01:03:33.461
Contrary to your belief, you are
not the center of my universe.

01:03:33.546 --> 01:03:36.589
I have bigger problems than you in
the southwest region to deal with.

01:03:36.674 --> 01:03:37.716
Hit him.

01:03:38.926 --> 01:03:42.262
Oh, God, are you gonna steal
my kidney and sell it?

01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:45.640
Could you please not do anything
awful for five seconds?

01:03:46.225 --> 01:03:49.853
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

01:03:49.937 --> 01:03:52.355
That's lithium dioxide. It's
gonna take the edge off.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.315
We're trying to get
you back to work.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.484
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:58.486
It's not a cure, it just
abates the symptoms.

01:03:58.571 --> 01:04:01.072
Doesn't look like it's
gonna be an easy fix.

01:04:01.157 --> 01:04:03.366
Trust me, I know. I'm
good at this stuff.

01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:05.827
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:10.331
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:13.501
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

01:04:14.962 --> 01:04:18.089
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

01:04:18.174 --> 01:04:19.716
Candygram.

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:25.388
I brought you something.

01:04:25.973 --> 01:04:27.724
Oh, yeah.

01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:32.103
We got you the bird, pal.

01:04:32.188 --> 01:04:33.521
This is not my bird.

01:04:33.939 --> 01:04:36.024
What do you mean? That's the bird.
This is the bird.

01:04:36.108 --> 01:04:38.902
Yeah. Pulled a lot of
strings to get this bird.

01:04:38.986 --> 01:04:40.278
This is a great bird.

01:04:40.362 --> 01:04:42.989
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

01:04:43.074 --> 01:04:45.533
Hey, man, this not my bird.

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:51.790
Well, listen, even if it's not the
bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

01:04:51.874 --> 01:04:54.667
I mean, you know, look, don't
get so attached to things.

01:04:54.752 --> 01:04:56.461
Learn to let go.

01:04:59.215 --> 01:05:01.716
Wait a minute. Jack,
what is that?

01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:05.386
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

01:05:13.896 --> 01:05:17.440
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.527
Is that a helmet? It doesn't
look like a helmet to me.

01:05:20.528 --> 01:05:23.113
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

01:05:23.197 --> 01:05:25.038
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

01:05:25.116 --> 01:05:28.326
Try to put your head in there. Go ahead.
Try to put your head in there.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:31.079
See, Ivan? He can't put
his head in there.

01:05:31.163 --> 01:05:35.542
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

01:05:35.626 --> 01:05:39.003
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:41.464
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:44.134
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

01:05:44.218 --> 01:05:46.010
People make problem.

01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:47.971
Trust me. Drone better.

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:52.600
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

01:05:53.477 --> 01:05:55.311
You said, "No problem."

01:05:55.396 --> 01:05:58.314
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

01:05:58.399 --> 01:06:01.192
Now I need suits. The
government wants suits.

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:03.278
Like Iron Man. You understand?

01:06:03.362 --> 01:06:06.489
That's what the people want. That's
what's gonna make them happy.

01:06:07.324 --> 01:06:08.658
Hey, man.

01:06:10.202 --> 01:06:12.787
Don't get too
attached to things.

01:06:13.497 --> 01:06:15.206
Learn to let go.

01:06:18.294 --> 01:06:21.296
These drones better
steal the show, Ivan.

01:06:21.922 --> 01:06:25.341
You understand? Better
rock my world, Ivan.

01:06:34.935 --> 01:06:36.603
Unbelievable.

01:06:37.062 --> 01:06:39.731
This ought to get the
Senate off my ass.

01:06:39.815 --> 01:06:43.193
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

01:06:43.569 --> 01:06:46.946
Good. Get Hammer down
here to weaponize it.

01:06:47.948 --> 01:06:48.990
Sir?

01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:51.701
Justin Hammer's making a weapons
presentation at the Expo.

01:06:51.785 --> 01:06:53.411
We'd like this to introduce it.

01:06:53.495 --> 01:06:55.079
Sir, I don't believe
that the Expo...

01:06:55.164 --> 01:06:57.957
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

01:06:58.042 --> 01:07:01.085
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:03.171
It's also an order.

01:07:03.547 --> 01:07:04.881
Yes, sir.

01:07:05.257 --> 01:07:08.718
Good work, Colonel. You've
made your country proud.

01:07:08.802 --> 01:07:10.428
Thank you, sir.

01:07:16.602 --> 01:07:20.313
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

01:07:20.397 --> 01:07:21.439
No, it was finished.

01:07:21.523 --> 01:07:25.652
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

01:07:25.736 --> 01:07:27.862
No. Howard said the arc reactor

01:07:27.947 --> 01:07:29.697
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

01:07:29.782 --> 01:07:34.285
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

01:07:34.787 --> 01:07:35.912
He was on to something big,

01:07:35.996 --> 01:07:39.457
something so big that it was
gonna make the nuclear reactor

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.542
look like a triple-A battery.

01:07:41.627 --> 01:07:44.128
Just him, or was Anton
Vanko in on this, too?

01:07:44.213 --> 01:07:47.298
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:49.425
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:51.886
When your father found
out, he had him deported.

01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:53.888
When the Russians found
out he couldn't deliver,

01:07:53.973 --> 01:07:55.515
they shipped his
ass off to Siberia

01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:58.351
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

01:07:58.435 --> 01:08:00.979
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

01:08:01.063 --> 01:08:05.191
the son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:06.901
You told me I hadn't
tried everything.

01:08:06.986 --> 01:08:08.079
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything?

01:08:08.092 --> 01:08:09.195
What haven't I tried?

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.533
He said that you were the only
person with the means and knowledge

01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:15.660
to finish what he started.

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:17.245
He said that?

01:08:17.413 --> 01:08:20.039
Are you that guy? Are you?

01:08:20.124 --> 01:08:25.420
'Cause if you are, then you can
solve the riddle of your heart.

01:08:29.717 --> 01:08:31.175
I don't know where you
get your information,

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.511
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

01:08:33.595 --> 01:08:34.995
What do you remember
about your dad?

01:08:35.055 --> 01:08:36.764
He was cold, he was calculating.

01:08:36.849 --> 01:08:39.600
He never told me he loved me. He
never even told me he liked me,

01:08:39.685 --> 01:08:41.269
so it's a little tough
for me to digest

01:08:41.353 --> 01:08:43.896
when you're telling me he said the
whole future was riding on me

01:08:43.897 --> 01:08:46.858
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

01:08:46.942 --> 01:08:48.192
You're talking about a
guy whose happiest day

01:08:48.277 --> 01:08:49.777
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

01:08:49.862 --> 01:08:50.945
That's not true.

01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:53.698
Well, then, clearly you knew
my dad better than I did.

01:08:54.116 --> 01:08:57.785
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one
of the founding members of S.H.I.E.I.D.

01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:59.037
What?

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.664
- I got a 2: 00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:03.310
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:05.126
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:07.086
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

01:09:07.171 --> 01:09:10.423
Natasha will remain a floater
at Stark with her cover intact.

01:09:10.507 --> 01:09:13.426
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

01:09:13.844 --> 01:09:15.345
And Tony,

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:19.599
remember, I got my eye on you.

01:09:25.647 --> 01:09:28.900
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

01:09:28.984 --> 01:09:30.360
Good luck.

01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:35.698
Please.

01:09:36.283 --> 01:09:39.494
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

01:09:39.578 --> 01:09:41.746
If we could send one of your go
on squad down to The Coffee Bean,

01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:44.415
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or
something like that, that'd be nice.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.625
I'm not here for that.

01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:47.189
I've been authorised
by Director Fury

01:09:47.252 --> 01:09:49.712
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

01:09:49.797 --> 01:09:52.423
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

01:09:52.508 --> 01:09:55.718
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

01:09:55.803 --> 01:09:58.054
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

01:09:58.138 --> 01:10:00.014
Enjoy your evening's
entertainment.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.000
Think this is the power source?

01:10:28.085 --> 01:10:32.880
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

01:10:34.007 --> 01:10:35.341
Yes, sir.

01:10:35.759 --> 01:10:37.051
Oh, yes!

01:10:37.469 --> 01:10:39.387
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:41.222
Is it my birthday?

01:10:41.515 --> 01:10:44.934
You got it. What did you do?
What did you do?

01:10:48.063 --> 01:10:50.898
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

01:10:50.983 --> 01:10:54.068
Hammer, I want to know what
you're gonna do for us.

01:10:54.236 --> 01:10:55.736
What am I going to do for you?

01:10:55.821 --> 01:10:58.948
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for
you is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

01:10:58.949 --> 01:11:01.951
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

01:11:02.035 --> 01:11:04.370
I'm talking about firepower.

01:11:05.873 --> 01:11:07.957
Well, you're talking
to the right guy.

01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:12.545
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

01:11:13.839 --> 01:11:16.174
Too downtown? I agree.

01:11:16.717 --> 01:11:18.968
M24 shotgun, pump action.

01:11:19.595 --> 01:11:20.887
Five-round magazine.

01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:22.388
You know what?
You're not a hunter.

01:11:22.389 --> 01:11:24.474
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:27.018
This is the FN-2000
from Belgium.

01:11:27.102 --> 01:11:29.395
They do make something
better than waffles.

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:32.356
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

01:11:32.441 --> 01:11:33.733
so I'm gonna put it right here.

01:11:33.817 --> 01:11:36.861
You're looking at a Milkor
40mm grenade launcher.

01:11:36.945 --> 01:11:39.989
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.574
You're tough.

01:11:41.658 --> 01:11:44.160
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

01:11:44.244 --> 01:11:45.745
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:49.457
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:53.002
Six individual barrels. The
torso taker, powder maker.

01:11:53.086 --> 01:11:55.213
Our boys in uniform
call it Uncle Gazpacho,

01:11:55.297 --> 01:11:57.673
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:01.761
Okay.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.475
These are the Cubans, baby. This
is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:11.062
This is a kinetic-kill,
side-winder vehicle

01:12:11.146 --> 01:12:15.441
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

01:12:16.026 --> 01:12:19.529
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:21.781
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

01:12:21.865 --> 01:12:25.284
A book that would make Ulysses look
like it was written in crayon.

01:12:25.869 --> 01:12:27.119
It would read it to you.

01:12:27.788 --> 01:12:29.288
This is my Eiffel Tower.

01:12:29.373 --> 01:12:32.458
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird.
My Pietà.

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:35.628
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:40.424
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:43.427
I call it the Ex-Wife.

01:12:48.558 --> 01:12:50.476
That's the best I got.

01:12:55.565 --> 01:12:57.233
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

01:12:57.317 --> 01:13:01.279
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:04.240
- Which one?
- All of it.

01:13:06.201 --> 01:13:07.243
All of it.

01:13:44.656 --> 01:13:48.284
Everything is achievable
through technology.

01:13:48.535 --> 01:13:50.911
Better living, robust health

01:13:50.996 --> 01:13:56.834
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

01:13:57.336 --> 01:13:58.586
I'm Howard Stark,

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:02.673
and everything you'll need for the
future can be found right here.

01:14:02.799 --> 01:14:05.801
City of the Future? City of Tomorrow?
City of...

01:14:11.641 --> 01:14:12.767
I'm Howard Stark,

01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:16.771
and everything you'll need in the
future can be found right here.

01:14:16.855 --> 01:14:19.690
So, from all of us
at Stark industries,

01:14:19.816 --> 01:14:22.109
I would like to personally...

01:14:22.694 --> 01:14:24.945
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:28.657
Put that back. Put it back
where you got it from.

01:14:28.867 --> 01:14:31.035
Where's your mother? Maria?

01:14:31.453 --> 01:14:33.371
Go on. Go, go, go, go.

01:14:35.665 --> 01:14:37.875
All right, I think we got...

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:40.044
I'll... I'll...
I'll come in and...

01:14:43.965 --> 01:14:45.883
Are you waiting on me?

01:14:47.677 --> 01:14:52.306
So, from all of us at Stark industries,
I'd like to personally show you

01:14:53.058 --> 01:14:54.141
my ass.

01:14:54.226 --> 01:14:56.310
I'd like to... I can't...
This is...

01:14:56.395 --> 01:14:58.729
I can't... We have
this, don't we?

01:14:58.855 --> 01:15:01.816
This is a ridiculous way...

01:15:02.234 --> 01:15:03.734
Everything

01:15:04.736 --> 01:15:06.237
is achievable

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.906
through technology.

01:15:21.378 --> 01:15:22.503
Tony?

01:15:22.587 --> 01:15:24.505
You're too young to
understand this right now,

01:15:24.589 --> 01:15:27.591
so I thought I would put
it on film for you.

01:15:29.428 --> 01:15:31.262
I built this for you.

01:15:32.264 --> 01:15:34.849
And someday you'll realise that
it represents a whole lot more

01:15:34.933 --> 01:15:38.936
than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.

01:15:40.105 --> 01:15:42.440
This is the key to the future.

01:15:45.402 --> 01:15:50.197
I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.

01:15:51.074 --> 01:15:52.783
And when you do,

01:15:53.702 --> 01:15:55.786
you will change the world.

01:15:57.247 --> 01:16:01.208
What is and always will
be my greatest creation

01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:04.962
is you.

01:16:25.942 --> 01:16:28.736
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.404
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:31.655
No, it's fine. Take that.

01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:33.782
- It's fine.
- No, señor.

01:16:33.992 --> 01:16:36.994
Take it. Take it. I don't like
people handing me things.

01:16:37.078 --> 01:16:38.996
If you just drop that
there, that'd be great.

01:16:39.331 --> 01:16:41.957
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.834
We believe in you.

01:16:44.294 --> 01:16:47.004
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

01:16:47.422 --> 01:16:48.506
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

01:16:48.632 --> 01:16:49.673
- Mr. Stark...
- Is here.

01:16:49.758 --> 01:16:51.592
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

01:16:51.676 --> 01:16:54.261
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

01:16:54.346 --> 01:16:56.597
that Stark has and
continues to maintain

01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:59.433
proprietary ownership of
the Mark II platform.

01:16:59.518 --> 01:17:02.269
When Mr. Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,

01:17:02.354 --> 01:17:04.522
- he was making a promise to America.
- No, the suit belongs to us.

01:17:04.648 --> 01:17:06.524
We trusted that he
would look out for us.

01:17:06.650 --> 01:17:08.817
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- He obviously did not.

01:17:08.818 --> 01:17:11.111
- And now we learn that his secretary...
- Yes, it does.

01:17:11.196 --> 01:17:13.531
A woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

01:17:13.657 --> 01:17:16.367
has been appointed as CEO
of Stark industries.

01:17:16.451 --> 01:17:17.952
What are her qualifications?

01:17:18.036 --> 01:17:19.119
- No.
- Ms Potts is doing

01:17:19.204 --> 01:17:20.371
nothing to manage
this terrible...

01:17:20.455 --> 01:17:21.956
- Mute.
- No...

01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.792
Burt... Burt...
Burt, listen to me.

01:17:24.876 --> 01:17:27.294
Don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

01:17:27.379 --> 01:17:29.505
and then not let me pursue this.

01:17:29.881 --> 01:17:30.965
I'll get this stuff out of here.

01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:33.884
Well, then, tell the
President to sign an order.

01:17:34.678 --> 01:17:36.136
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

01:17:36.221 --> 01:17:39.223
Hammer's giving some
presentation tomorrow evening.

01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:42.184
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

01:17:42.811 --> 01:17:45.062
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

01:17:46.356 --> 01:17:47.398
- Got a minute?
- No.

01:17:47.524 --> 01:17:50.234
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

01:17:51.695 --> 01:17:53.988
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

01:17:54.072 --> 01:17:55.739
I was just driving over here,

01:17:55.824 --> 01:17:58.325
and I thought I was coming to
basically apologise, but I'm not.

01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:01.171
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

01:18:01.246 --> 01:18:02.830
and I'm working on that.

01:18:02.914 --> 01:18:06.917
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

01:18:07.002 --> 01:18:08.168
and I just want to
try to make good.

01:18:08.253 --> 01:18:10.588
Can I move this? This is crazy.

01:18:10.672 --> 01:18:11.755
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

01:18:11.881 --> 01:18:13.161
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.095
Do you know how short life is?

01:18:18.221 --> 01:18:21.265
And if I never got to express...

01:18:21.349 --> 01:18:24.018
And by the way, this is
somewhat revelatory to me.

01:18:24.102 --> 01:18:26.520
And I don't care... I mean, I care.
It would be nice.

01:18:26.605 --> 01:18:28.272
I'm not expecting you to...

01:18:28.356 --> 01:18:29.523
Look, here's what
I'm trying to say.

01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:31.442
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:34.028
Because if you say
"I" one more time,

01:18:34.112 --> 01:18:36.905
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:39.366
I am trying to run a company.

01:18:39.451 --> 01:18:42.036
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.122
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man and you've disappeared,

01:18:45.206 --> 01:18:48.542
and all I'm doing is putting out your
fires and taking the heat for it.

01:18:51.129 --> 01:18:54.632
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

01:18:58.386 --> 01:19:00.721
Did you bring me strawberries?

01:19:01.806 --> 01:19:05.225
Did you know that there's only one
thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:07.603
Allergic to strawberries.

01:19:10.148 --> 01:19:11.148
This is progress, Pepper.

01:19:11.274 --> 01:19:13.984
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

01:19:14.903 --> 01:19:16.236
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

01:19:16.237 --> 01:19:18.906
To leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

01:19:24.079 --> 01:19:25.496
Ms Potts?

01:19:26.122 --> 01:19:29.458
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

01:19:30.001 --> 01:19:31.335
Thank you.

01:19:33.129 --> 01:19:34.672
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

01:19:34.673 --> 01:19:37.800
No, I'll be just...
another minute.

01:19:38.802 --> 01:19:40.427
I lost both the kids
in the divorce.

01:19:44.683 --> 01:19:45.766
No.

01:19:47.936 --> 01:19:53.023
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

01:19:54.192 --> 01:19:56.443
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

01:19:56.528 --> 01:19:59.446
I thought you two
didn't get along.

01:19:59.531 --> 01:20:02.866
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

01:20:03.034 --> 01:20:05.452
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

01:20:05.537 --> 01:20:08.622
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the
matter of the personal belongings.

01:20:08.707 --> 01:20:10.165
Absolutely.

01:20:16.631 --> 01:20:17.631
I'm surprised you can
keep your mouth shut.

01:20:17.716 --> 01:20:18.799
Boy, you're good.

01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:21.468
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

01:20:21.553 --> 01:20:23.387
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

01:20:23.471 --> 01:20:25.723
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

01:20:25.849 --> 01:20:26.890
Do you even speak Latin?

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.729
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

01:20:31.813 --> 01:20:35.065
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:38.068
You're good.

01:21:37.837 --> 01:21:40.506
Jarvis, could you kindly
Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?

01:21:40.632 --> 01:21:43.133
I need a manipulatable
projection.

01:21:50.433 --> 01:21:53.977
1974 Stark Expo model
scan complete, sir.

01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:58.023
How many buildings are there?

01:21:58.149 --> 01:22:00.567
Am I to include the
Belgian waffle stands?

01:22:00.652 --> 01:22:03.195
That was rhetorical.
Just show me.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.587
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

01:22:20.672 --> 01:22:24.174
In which case the
nucleus would be here.

01:22:25.218 --> 01:22:27.344
Highlight the unisphere.

01:22:36.145 --> 01:22:41.149
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

01:22:41.234 --> 01:22:43.068
I'm discovering... Correction.

01:22:43.194 --> 01:22:47.155
I'm rediscovering a new
element, I believe.

01:22:47.907 --> 01:22:50.951
Lose the landscaping, the
shrubbery, the trees.

01:22:51.035 --> 01:22:53.370
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:04.172
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

01:23:07.218 --> 01:23:08.385
Dad.

01:23:29.616 --> 01:23:34.411
Dead for almost 20 years, and
still taking me to school.

01:23:40.585 --> 01:23:45.213
The proposed element should serve as
a viable replacement for palladium.

01:23:45.298 --> 01:23:46.381
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:46.466 --> 01:23:49.718
Unfortunately, it is
impossible to synthesise.

01:23:54.265 --> 01:23:57.809
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:47.442
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

01:24:48.027 --> 01:24:49.945
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

01:24:50.029 --> 01:24:54.032
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

01:24:54.158 --> 01:24:56.118
Hey, I'm playing for the
home team, Coulson,

01:24:56.202 --> 01:24:58.286
you and all your Fabulous
Furry Freak Brothers.

01:24:58.371 --> 01:25:00.291
Now, are you gonna let me
work or break my balls?

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.501
What's this doing here?

01:25:06.337 --> 01:25:07.379
That's it.

01:25:08.673 --> 01:25:10.799
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

01:25:10.883 --> 01:25:12.563
It's exactly what I
need to make this work.

01:25:14.345 --> 01:25:15.387
Lift the coil.

01:25:15.888 --> 01:25:17.222
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

01:25:17.974 --> 01:25:19.850
There you go. And...

01:25:20.852 --> 01:25:22.811
Drop it. Drop it.

01:25:25.982 --> 01:25:29.067
Perfectly level. I'm busy.
What do you want?

01:25:29.193 --> 01:25:32.362
Nothing. Goodbye.
I've been reassigned.

01:25:32.905 --> 01:25:34.489
Director Fury wants
me in New Mexico.

01:25:34.574 --> 01:25:37.033
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.202
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.621
- Good luck.
- Bye.

01:25:41.706 --> 01:25:43.790
- Thanks.
- We need you.

01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:46.877
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:07.856
Initialising prismatic
accelerator.

01:26:13.905 --> 01:26:16.364
Approaching maximum power.

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.080
That was easy.

01:27:21.639 --> 01:27:23.598
Congratulations, sir.

01:27:25.309 --> 01:27:27.811
You have created a new element.

01:27:35.778 --> 01:27:39.573
Sir, the reactor has
accepted the modified core.

01:27:39.657 --> 01:27:42.284
I will begin running
diagnostics.

01:27:48.165 --> 01:27:49.499
Hey, Ivan.

01:27:49.792 --> 01:27:51.418
I got Senator Stern here.

01:27:51.502 --> 01:27:53.962
Thought we'd swing over and look
at some of the drone designs.

01:27:53.963 --> 01:27:56.214
The drone is not
going to be ready.

01:27:56.507 --> 01:27:57.716
Not ready? What do you mean?

01:27:57.842 --> 01:28:01.261
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

01:28:01.345 --> 01:28:03.346
What the hell is the difference?

01:28:03.472 --> 01:28:06.224
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

01:28:06.517 --> 01:28:08.351
Well, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:28:08.477 --> 01:28:11.563
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:14.983
- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?

01:28:15.067 --> 01:28:16.443
What do you mean, "make salute"?

01:28:16.527 --> 01:28:20.614
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

01:28:20.698 --> 01:28:23.325
You promised me suits and
then you promised me drones.

01:28:23.409 --> 01:28:27.537
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

01:28:39.675 --> 01:28:42.260
Hey, there he is.
It's the bird man.

01:28:43.846 --> 01:28:49.434
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

01:28:50.394 --> 01:28:53.772
You said it wasn't, but now it
looks like you're best of pals.

01:28:53.898 --> 01:28:55.825
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what?

01:28:55.838 --> 01:28:57.776
Take the bird.

01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:00.737
Hey!

01:29:02.782 --> 01:29:05.450
Take his pillows, too.
Both of them.

01:29:06.744 --> 01:29:08.662
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.417
I took your stuff.

01:29:14.502 --> 01:29:17.671
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

01:29:18.422 --> 01:29:21.091
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:24.928
We had a contract.

01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:27.305
I saved your life

01:29:28.099 --> 01:29:30.100
and you give me suits.

01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.352
That was our deal.

01:29:32.436 --> 01:29:34.479
And you did not deliver.

01:29:35.314 --> 01:29:39.818
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

01:29:42.154 --> 01:29:45.490
Something really, really
great fell into my lap.

01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:49.327
And if it hadn't, I'd be
at your mercy tonight.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:53.373
Now I have a piece of Stark
tech that I pimped out myself.

01:29:53.624 --> 01:29:55.375
And now your overpriced
paperweights

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:58.044
are gonna look like a
backdrop to my demonstration.

01:29:58.546 --> 01:30:00.797
Do you dig what I'm
getting at here?

01:30:03.009 --> 01:30:07.303
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

01:30:10.683 --> 01:30:12.559
I'm gonna leave now.

01:30:12.643 --> 01:30:15.729
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.314
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

01:30:18.482 --> 01:30:20.984
They are not to be trifled with.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.236
When I get back, we're
gonna renegotiate

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.655
the terms of our agreement.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.324
And you're gonna make
good on our arrangement

01:30:28.826 --> 01:30:29.951
because if you don't,

01:30:30.036 --> 01:30:32.454
you're gonna be exactly what
you were when I found you,

01:30:32.538 --> 01:30:34.205
a dead man.

01:30:34.331 --> 01:30:35.707
You got that?

01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:39.002
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

01:30:48.429 --> 01:30:50.805
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess?
You're killing me.

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.330
- You know I don't...
- Incoming call

01:30:52.391 --> 01:30:54.142
with a blocked number, sir.

01:30:54.226 --> 01:30:57.437
My phone privilege is reinstated.
Lovely.

01:30:57.521 --> 01:30:59.064
Coulson. How's the
Land of Enchantment?

01:30:59.065 --> 01:31:01.775
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.403
- I double cycle.
- You what?

01:31:06.405 --> 01:31:10.283
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

01:31:10.618 --> 01:31:12.285
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

01:31:12.369 --> 01:31:13.870
You, too.

01:31:16.457 --> 01:31:17.791
- Trace him.
- Sir.

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:21.628
Now, the true history of
Stark name will be written.

01:31:21.712 --> 01:31:22.796
Jarvis, where is he?

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.008
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.

01:31:27.093 --> 01:31:31.221
What your father did to
my family over 40 years,

01:31:32.056 --> 01:31:34.724
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

01:31:34.892 --> 01:31:36.810
Sounds good. Let's get
together and hash it out.

01:31:37.103 --> 01:31:38.436
Tri-State area.

01:31:38.562 --> 01:31:40.772
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

01:31:40.898 --> 01:31:42.774
I hope you're ready.

01:31:45.569 --> 01:31:47.570
Call trace incomplete.

01:31:58.124 --> 01:32:00.750
- Sir...
- You want to run some tests, run them.

01:32:01.752 --> 01:32:03.711
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

01:32:03.796 --> 01:32:06.636
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

01:32:10.636 --> 01:32:12.720
That tastes like coconut.

01:32:12.805 --> 01:32:14.514
And metal.

01:32:14.849 --> 01:32:16.432
Oh, wow, yeah!

01:32:29.029 --> 01:32:30.864
I'll keep the car
down here, all right?

01:32:30.948 --> 01:32:32.240
Thank you, Happy.

01:32:32.324 --> 01:32:37.120
Justin Hammer. His presentation will
begin shortly in the main pavilion.

01:32:55.556 --> 01:32:56.806
Yeah.

01:32:57.975 --> 01:33:01.311
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

01:33:01.896 --> 01:33:03.855
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long,

01:33:03.981 --> 01:33:08.484
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

01:33:08.652 --> 01:33:10.278
but then the Iron Man arrived,

01:33:10.362 --> 01:33:14.032
and we thought the days of
losing lives were behind us.

01:33:14.867 --> 01:33:17.619
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

01:33:17.703 --> 01:33:20.038
That's not fair.
That's not right.

01:33:20.122 --> 01:33:22.373
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, Lord.

01:33:22.458 --> 01:33:24.542
Regardless, it was an
impressive innovation,

01:33:24.627 --> 01:33:27.545
one that grabbed headlines
the world over.

01:33:27.922 --> 01:33:29.547
Well, today, my friends,

01:33:29.632 --> 01:33:33.092
the press is faced with
quite a different problem.

01:33:33.594 --> 01:33:36.095
They are about to
run out of ink.

01:33:41.644 --> 01:33:43.603
Get that out of here.

01:33:44.563 --> 01:33:46.439
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:47.483 --> 01:33:49.859
today I present to you

01:33:50.152 --> 01:33:53.321
the new face of the
United States military.

01:33:54.698 --> 01:33:55.990
The Hammer drone.

01:33:58.535 --> 01:33:59.953
Army!

01:34:13.092 --> 01:34:14.259
Navy!

01:34:24.478 --> 01:34:25.937
Air Force!

01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:35.113
Marines!

01:34:47.001 --> 01:34:49.627
Yeah!

01:34:53.298 --> 01:34:56.217
That's a hell of a lot better than
some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

01:34:57.344 --> 01:35:00.221
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

01:35:00.305 --> 01:35:04.017
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

01:35:04.601 --> 01:35:07.645
Ladies and gentlemen, today I
am proud to present to you

01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:09.480
the very first prototype

01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:12.859
in the Variable Threat
Response Battle Suit

01:35:12.943 --> 01:35:16.779
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

01:35:18.323 --> 01:35:18.823
What?

01:35:41.472 --> 01:35:44.640
For America and its allies, Hammer
Industries is reporting for...

01:36:00.783 --> 01:36:02.450
We got trouble.

01:36:02.534 --> 01:36:04.243
Tony, there are
civilians present.

01:36:04.328 --> 01:36:06.954
I'm here on orders. Let's
not do this right now.

01:36:07.039 --> 01:36:08.331
Give them a wave.

01:36:08.415 --> 01:36:10.583
Hey, all right. Yeah.

01:36:10.667 --> 01:36:12.710
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

01:36:12.795 --> 01:36:14.796
You gotta trust me for
the next five minutes.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.964
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

01:36:17.049 --> 01:36:19.092
Listen, I think he's
working with Vanko.

01:36:19.176 --> 01:36:20.802
Vanko's alive?

01:36:22.012 --> 01:36:23.179
Yeah.

01:36:23.263 --> 01:36:24.514
Where is he?

01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:26.891
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:28.643
- Who?
- Tell me.

01:36:29.269 --> 01:36:31.270
What are you doing here, man?

01:36:31.355 --> 01:36:33.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:36:37.402 --> 01:36:39.821
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

01:36:40.906 --> 01:36:43.574
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

01:36:44.368 --> 01:36:46.649
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

01:36:47.913 --> 01:36:49.831
Let's take it outside.

01:37:01.969 --> 01:37:03.219
No. No!

01:37:13.188 --> 01:37:16.399
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

01:37:18.235 --> 01:37:21.154
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

01:37:21.238 --> 01:37:22.905
- On what?
- On you.

01:37:27.911 --> 01:37:29.745
Tony, on your six!

01:37:47.097 --> 01:37:49.432
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

01:37:49.558 --> 01:37:50.766
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

01:37:50.851 --> 01:37:52.185
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

01:37:52.269 --> 01:37:53.352
That's impossible.

01:37:53.437 --> 01:37:55.104
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:57.356
Well, then call their...
Call their cells.

01:37:57.441 --> 01:37:58.941
Their cell phones are not
working, either, sir.

01:37:59.067 --> 01:38:00.276
He's locked us out
of the mainframe.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.527
Who's locked you out
of the mainframe?

01:38:01.612 --> 01:38:03.196
Please, please, go away.
Go away.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.614
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

01:38:04.698 --> 01:38:05.781
Yes, I do.

01:38:05.908 --> 01:38:08.367
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed
up, this wouldn't be happening.

01:38:08.452 --> 01:38:10.786
So please, now go away.
Thank you.

01:38:11.205 --> 01:38:13.539
Listen, we got to get these
bitches out of here.

01:38:13.749 --> 01:38:15.208
What?

01:38:15.292 --> 01:38:16.626
You tell me who's behind this.

01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:21.255
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

01:38:21.632 --> 01:38:24.258
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

01:38:27.596 --> 01:38:29.222
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

01:38:29.306 --> 01:38:30.598
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

01:38:30.599 --> 01:38:32.475
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

01:38:32.601 --> 01:38:34.644
Step aside. Step aside.

01:38:35.604 --> 01:38:37.271
Tell me everything you know. Go.

01:38:44.655 --> 01:38:47.657
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

01:39:05.175 --> 01:39:06.676
This way.

01:39:07.344 --> 01:39:09.178
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

01:39:09.263 --> 01:39:11.514
Get in the car. Take me
to Hammer Industries.

01:39:11.598 --> 01:39:14.016
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:16.644
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

01:40:15.078 --> 01:40:16.746
Nice work, kid.

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.876
- You got multiples coming in on you.
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

01:40:27.257 --> 01:40:29.675
When we arrive, I need you
to watch the perimeter.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.429
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

01:40:35.724 --> 01:40:38.351
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

01:41:08.757 --> 01:41:09.799
Listen, listen.

01:41:09.925 --> 01:41:11.926
A pack just peeled off. They're
headed back to the Expo.

01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:13.344
Got it.

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.599
I'm closing on you.

01:41:18.683 --> 01:41:21.102
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony.
Watch it.

01:41:36.952 --> 01:41:39.620
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

01:41:39.704 --> 01:41:41.288
I said, stay in the car.

01:41:41.456 --> 01:41:43.457
What are you wearing?

01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:47.002
Look, I'm not letting
you go in there alone.

01:41:47.129 --> 01:41:48.504
You want to help?
Keep the car running.

01:41:48.630 --> 01:41:49.880
Okay.

01:41:53.385 --> 01:41:55.678
Hey, hey, hey. You
can't come in here.

01:41:56.138 --> 01:41:57.680
Hold on. Hey!

01:42:42.392 --> 01:42:44.310
Each set of drones
is communicating

01:42:44.394 --> 01:42:47.146
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.231
Have you tried Russian? Why
don't you try Russian?

01:42:52.903 --> 01:42:55.279
Attention. We have
intrusion on Grid W.

01:42:55.363 --> 01:42:57.615
We got it. We're on our way.

01:43:39.074 --> 01:43:40.491
I got him!

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.383
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

01:43:57.467 --> 01:44:00.970
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

01:44:03.139 --> 01:44:04.265
Wait, wait, wait!

01:44:23.827 --> 01:44:25.286
He's gone.

01:44:29.332 --> 01:44:31.375
I'm sorry, buddy. Had
to thin out the herd.

01:44:32.168 --> 01:44:34.003
What's your 20?

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.475
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

01:44:54.858 --> 01:44:55.899
Tony!

01:45:12.417 --> 01:45:14.084
Reboot complete.

01:45:14.753 --> 01:45:16.503
You got your best friend back.

01:45:16.588 --> 01:45:19.965
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
- Well done with the new chest piece.

01:45:20.050 --> 01:45:23.719
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

01:45:23.803 --> 01:45:26.555
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.724
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?

01:45:28.808 --> 01:45:30.559
Is that you? No, I'm not.

01:45:30.644 --> 01:45:32.186
- Not any more.
- What's going on?

01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:34.021
I was going to tell you. I
didn't want to alarm you.

01:45:34.105 --> 01:45:35.606
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?

01:45:35.732 --> 01:45:37.441
- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

01:45:37.567 --> 01:45:40.277
I was gonna make you an
omelette and tell you.

01:45:40.403 --> 01:45:43.322
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

01:45:43.406 --> 01:45:44.990
Looks like the fight's
coming to you.

01:45:45.075 --> 01:45:46.909
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

01:45:46.993 --> 01:45:48.202
I am fine. Don't be mad.

01:45:48.286 --> 01:45:49.953
- I will formally apologise...
- I am mad!

01:45:49.954 --> 01:45:52.915
When I'm not fending
off a Hammeroid attack.

01:45:52.999 --> 01:45:54.439
- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.

01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:55.542
Oh, please.

01:45:58.922 --> 01:46:00.297
Rhodes?

01:46:00.757 --> 01:46:03.425
Snap out of it, buddy.
I need you.

01:46:04.177 --> 01:46:06.470
They're coming. Come on, let's roll.
Get up.

01:46:09.766 --> 01:46:11.934
Oh, man. You can
have your suit back.

01:46:15.438 --> 01:46:16.772
You okay?

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.482
Yeah, thanks.

01:46:20.026 --> 01:46:22.444
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

01:46:22.529 --> 01:46:23.737
No. I should have
trusted you more.

01:46:23.822 --> 01:46:25.406
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:27.825
No. It's your fault. I just
wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:46:27.951 --> 01:46:31.203
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

01:46:31.454 --> 01:46:35.040
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

01:46:35.667 --> 01:46:37.292
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

01:46:37.377 --> 01:46:38.961
So let's put the biggest
gun up on that Ridge.

01:46:39.045 --> 01:46:40.337
Got you.

01:46:41.172 --> 01:46:42.256
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.980
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:46.051
You have a big gun. You
are not the big gun.

01:46:46.136 --> 01:46:47.511
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

01:46:47.637 --> 01:46:48.762
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

01:46:48.847 --> 01:46:51.348
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

01:46:52.058 --> 01:46:55.436
All right. You go up top.
I'll draw them in.

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.396
Don't stay down here. This
is the worst place to be.

01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.731
Okay, you got a spot.
Where's mine?

01:46:58.815 --> 01:47:06.815
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

01:47:51.534 --> 01:47:53.243
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

01:48:01.252 --> 01:48:02.544
Rhodey?

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.380
Get down.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.060
Wow. I think you should
lead with that next time.

01:48:18.144 --> 01:48:21.480
Yeah. Sorry, boss. I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:26.068
I told you that
five minutes ago.

01:48:27.403 --> 01:48:28.779
That's your guy here.

01:48:30.114 --> 01:48:32.115
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

01:48:32.242 --> 01:48:33.659
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

01:48:33.743 --> 01:48:35.410
I'm trying to help here.

01:48:39.499 --> 01:48:43.043
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

01:48:43.127 --> 01:48:44.711
That's good. That's good.

01:48:44.796 --> 01:48:47.756
You're starting to think like a
CEO, taking out the competition.

01:48:47.924 --> 01:48:50.300
I like that. You think you're
making a problem for me?

01:48:50.426 --> 01:48:51.468
I'm gonna make a
problem for you.

01:48:51.594 --> 01:48:54.596
I'm gonna be seeing
you again real soon.

01:48:58.768 --> 01:49:00.269
When they get here, I think
you should station them

01:49:00.353 --> 01:49:03.188
at the South, east
and both west exits.

01:49:03.273 --> 01:49:05.357
We shut down the 7 train in and
out of Willets Point already.

01:49:05.441 --> 01:49:08.235
Well, have city buses there to
ferry people to operating lines.

01:49:08.319 --> 01:49:09.820
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

01:49:09.946 --> 01:49:11.665
No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.407
Okay.

01:49:15.159 --> 01:49:17.661
Heads up. You got one
more drone incoming.

01:49:17.787 --> 01:49:19.121
This one looks different.

01:49:19.581 --> 01:49:21.957
The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

01:49:33.052 --> 01:49:34.720
Good to be back.

01:49:35.305 --> 01:49:36.680
This ain't gonna be good.

01:49:40.226 --> 01:49:42.311
I got something
special for this guy.

01:49:42.478 --> 01:49:44.605
I'm gonna bust his
bunker with the Ex-Wife.

01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:46.148
With the what?

01:49:56.534 --> 01:49:59.036
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

01:50:00.872 --> 01:50:02.456
I got this.

01:50:55.385 --> 01:50:57.386
Rhodes. I got an idea.

01:50:57.762 --> 01:51:00.263
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

01:51:00.598 --> 01:51:03.558
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

01:51:03.643 --> 01:51:05.519
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:08.814
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Go, go, go!

01:51:12.610 --> 01:51:13.694
Take it.

01:51:42.265 --> 01:51:43.682
You lose.

01:51:51.232 --> 01:51:53.984
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

01:51:54.485 --> 01:51:55.736
Pepper?

01:52:35.902 --> 01:52:37.652
Oh, my God! I can't
take this any more.

01:52:37.737 --> 01:52:39.154
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

01:52:39.238 --> 01:52:40.655
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:41.990
cannot handle the stress.

01:52:42.074 --> 01:52:46.578
I never know if you're gonna kill
yourself or wreck the whole company.

01:52:46.662 --> 01:52:48.663
I think I did okay.

01:52:48.831 --> 01:52:50.874
I quit. I'm resigning.

01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:52.876
That's it.

01:52:53.461 --> 01:52:56.046
What did you just say?
You're done?

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.842
That's surprising. No, it's
not surprising. I get it.

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.554
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

01:53:04.639 --> 01:53:05.764
You actually were
just making excuses.

01:53:05.848 --> 01:53:07.349
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

01:53:07.433 --> 01:53:08.767
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

01:53:08.851 --> 01:53:11.186
- You deserve better.
- Well...

01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:13.855
You've taken such
good care of me.

01:53:14.732 --> 01:53:17.150
I've been in a tough spot, but
you got me through it, so...

01:53:17.235 --> 01:53:18.485
Right?

01:53:18.569 --> 01:53:19.820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:53:20.613 --> 01:53:23.573
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

01:53:23.658 --> 01:53:24.980
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

01:53:24.993 --> 01:53:26.326
Okay. What about the press?

01:53:26.410 --> 01:53:28.286
Because you only had the job for a week.
That's gonna seem...

01:53:28.371 --> 01:53:30.163
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

01:53:30.164 --> 01:53:31.564
I mean, it's like
the Presidency...

01:53:44.595 --> 01:53:45.846
Weird.

01:53:46.097 --> 01:53:47.617
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

01:53:47.682 --> 01:53:49.599
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

01:53:49.684 --> 01:53:51.560
I think it was weird.

01:53:51.978 --> 01:53:54.938
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

01:53:55.481 --> 01:53:57.941
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

01:53:58.025 --> 01:54:00.527
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

01:54:00.611 --> 01:54:03.530
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

01:54:04.448 --> 01:54:06.992
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

01:54:07.076 --> 01:54:09.703
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

01:54:09.787 --> 01:54:12.289
Listen, my car got taken
out in the explosion,

01:54:12.373 --> 01:54:15.542
so I'm gonna have to hang on to
your suit for a minute, okay?

01:54:15.626 --> 01:54:17.377
Not okay. Not okay with that.

01:54:17.962 --> 01:54:19.212
It wasn't a question.

01:54:24.802 --> 01:54:28.138
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

01:54:48.618 --> 01:54:50.910
I don't think I want
you looking at that.

01:54:51.078 --> 01:54:53.246
I'm not sure it pertains
to you any more.

01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:58.585
Now this, on the other hand, is
Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

01:54:59.837 --> 01:55:00.920
Read it.

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.843
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark
displays compulsive behaviour."

01:55:06.927 --> 01:55:09.095
In my own defence,
that was last week.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.975
"Prone to self-destructive
tendencies." I was dying.

01:55:14.101 --> 01:55:16.686
I mean, please. And
aren't we all?

01:55:17.063 --> 01:55:19.898
"Textbook narcissism"?

01:55:21.942 --> 01:55:23.026
Agreed.

01:55:24.111 --> 01:55:25.487
Okay, here it is.

01:55:25.571 --> 01:55:28.907
"Recruitment assessment for Avenger
Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

01:55:28.991 --> 01:55:31.534
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.622
"Tony Stark not...

01:55:35.706 --> 01:55:37.248
"Not recommended"?

01:55:38.459 --> 01:55:39.668
That doesn't make any sense.

01:55:39.752 --> 01:55:42.671
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

01:55:43.339 --> 01:55:44.756
I got a new ticker.

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.842
I'm trying to do
right by Pepper.

01:55:48.427 --> 01:55:51.346
I'm in a stable-ish
relationship.

01:55:52.181 --> 01:55:54.057
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

01:55:54.141 --> 01:55:57.310
we'd only like to use
you as a consultant.

01:56:04.235 --> 01:56:06.111
You can't afford me.

01:56:08.447 --> 01:56:10.699
Then again, I will waive
my customary retainer

01:56:10.783 --> 01:56:13.660
in exchange for a small favour.

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:19.541
Rhodey and I are being honoured in
Washington and we need a presenter.

01:56:21.377 --> 01:56:22.877
I'll see what I can do.

01:56:24.588 --> 01:56:29.426
It is my honour to be here today to
present these distinguished awards

01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:33.513
to Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes and Mr. Tony Stark,

01:56:33.597 --> 01:56:36.933
who is, of course, a
national treasure.

01:56:39.103 --> 01:56:40.437
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

01:56:40.521 --> 01:56:42.897
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:45.191
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:56:46.902 --> 01:56:48.194
Mr. Stark.

01:56:48.279 --> 01:56:52.365
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:54.117
You deserve this.

01:56:55.578 --> 01:56:58.037
Oh, sorry.

01:56:58.122 --> 01:57:01.541
Funny how annoying a little
prick can be, isn't it?

01:57:03.002 --> 01:57:04.794
Let's get a photo.

02:04:30.949 --> 02:04:32.909
Sir, we've found it.
